        Ripple Junction made the decision to migrate away from Magento 2 in early q2 2025.  I migrated the site from Magento 2 to Shopify in under 30 days, improving internal process and increasing customer satisfaction.  The migration was completed in May 2025, and the site has been running smoothly since then.  The migration was done with a focus on cost reduction, as well as improving the overall user experience.
