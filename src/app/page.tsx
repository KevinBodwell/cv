          <p>
            I have always been a Jack of all trades. I love to learn new things, and I love to build things. I have a passion for technology, design, and storytelling, and I enjoy blending these elements into projects that people love to use or wear.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a developer, builder, and creative problem solver based in Florida. Since 2017 I have been primarily working inside small and medium sized businesses working to make sure their eCommerce presence is top notch. Most this has been developing and maintaining Magento 2 / Adobe Commerce sites with several hosted on Adobe Commerce Cloud infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether I&apos;m building scalable web apps, debugging gnarly integration bugs, or creating a shirt brand from fictional national parks, I bring a hands-on, future-forward approach to every project.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love working with technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, and OpenCV, but I&apos;m just as comfortable getting my hands dirty with bash scripts, Raspberry Pi hacks, or physical product prototyping.
