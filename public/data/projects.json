Most of these designs have tried to avoid direct copyright infringment.  Lucas, for instance never trademarked, or allowed the trademarks to lapse on most location names.  Using just the name does directly infringe on copyright.  Much of the Disney library of fairytales come from public domain, so I just had to find methods to make sure they are not directly tied to anything Disney.
